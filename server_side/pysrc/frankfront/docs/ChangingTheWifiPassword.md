Chanding the Wifi password
--------------------------

Look for `wpa_passphrase` in `/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf`. There are other things 
there that can be used to tune the wifi configuration, but it is very easy to 
wreak. I suggest you to do a backup of the file always first before actually 
modifying.
