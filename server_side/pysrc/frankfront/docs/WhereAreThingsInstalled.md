Where are things installed
--------------------------

Everything is for the user `netcontrol`, with home `/home/netcontrol`. You
can find the services powering Frank there, in a subfolder called `software`. 
All the python scripts are executed by the interpreter at '/home/netcontrol/venv/bin/python',
where bindings for several libraries are installed.
