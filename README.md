This is part of the code powering the network router of my family. They live in a place where there
is no DSL or LAN connection, and they want to share a 56 kb modem through a wifi network. We couldn't
find the hardware able to do that directly, so I hacked a Rasperry pi to do it. 

The code at this repository is part of a simple control web-interface. It uses Ember.js and the usual 
Javascript suspects: underscore.js, JQuery....
